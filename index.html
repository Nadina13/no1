		<p>Oh, misty eye of the mountain below<br>Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls<br>And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke<br>Keep watching over Durin's son.</p>
		<p>If this is to end in fire<br>Then we should all burn together<br>Watch the flames climb high into the night<br>Calling out father oh, stand by and we will<br>Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey.</p>
		<p>And if we should die tonight<br>Then we should all die together<br>Raise a glass of wine for the last time<br>Calling out father oh<br>Prepare as we will<br>Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side<br>Desolation comes upon the sky.</p>
		<p>Now I see fire, inside the mountain<br>I see fire, burning the tree<br>And I see fire, hollowing souls<br>And I see fire, blood in the breeze<br>And I hope that you'll remember me.</p>
		<p>Oh, should my people</p>
